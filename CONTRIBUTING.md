# Contributing to backstage-plugin-api-linter

We are happy to accept contributions! This is what makes Open Source possible. We ask
that you follow these guidelines when contributing.

## Issues

Found a bug or have an idea for a feature? You can help us
by [creating an issue](https://github.com/zalando/backstage-plugin-api-linter/issues).
Just make sure that an issue describing the bug or feature does not already exist. You can go even further and
[open a Pull Request](https://github.com/zalando/backstage-plugin-api-linter/pulls) with the fix or proposed feature.

## Pull Requests

Follow these steps to contribute your work to backstage-plugin-api-linter:

1. [Open an issue](https://github.com/zalando/backstage-plugin-api-linter/issues) describing the problem or proposed
   feature. Ask maintainers (in the issue thread) to assign the issue to you so we know who is working on what.
2. Fork this repo and create a branch for your work.
3. Push changes to your branch.
4. Test your changes.
5. Open a [Pull Request](https://github.com/zalando/backstage-plugin-api-linter/pulls) when your code is ready for
   review.

## Commit style and releases

To ensure a seamless release process, please follow the Conventional Commits style. Use `yarn commit` to open a guided prompt (Commitizen) that helps you craft a valid message. Do not manually bump the version in package.json — versions are determined and published automatically by semantic-release based on commit history.

Thanks for your contribution!
